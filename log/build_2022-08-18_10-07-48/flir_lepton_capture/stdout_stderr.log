CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:31 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findflir_lepton_messages.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "flir_lepton_messages", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "flir_lepton_messages" with any of the following names:

    flir_lepton_messagesConfig.cmake
    flir_lepton_messages-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "flir_lepton_messages" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "flir_lepton_messages_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "flir_lepton_messages" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
